## Marketing Email

Dyspatch wants to send an email announcement about Dyspatch's AMP support to inform their marketing list about the possibilities and encourage them to try out the technology on Dyspatch's platform.

The email had a design already existing for us, but the blocks themselves needed to be created and the blog scraper needed caching implemented.

Broadly speaking the email implements most of AMPs most important features includeing a list to load data from a server, multiple forms for submitting data, and sensible fallback states for if the email can not connect to the internet or if it is sent to an email service provider that does not support AMP.
