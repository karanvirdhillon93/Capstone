 AMP was origonally developed by Google in 2015, as on open source technology to boost loading speeds on mobile devices.
 Then in 2018 Google announced AMP-powered emails, that would create a interactive email experience.
 Now in 2021 AMP-powered emails, let you shop, and fill out forms in your email withought leaving your inbox.
 AMP-powered emails allow us to bringing live data into emails, and provide a powerful user experience.
 Anytime we use AMP technology there are unilitmied new possiblites, because we can now make emails feel more like interactive webpages.


#Description of the project
We wanted to create a product review email, that would increase the product review submissions. By combining both AMP technology with Yotpo's product review system, we were able to create an email template. This email template would then be used by Dyspatch users, to send to their customers in email, asking for a product review. 
By allowing customers to fill out reviews withought needing to open a new browser tab, we hope to publish a valuable application for many businesses.
