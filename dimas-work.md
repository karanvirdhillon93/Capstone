## Description of the project

When you receive an email, in a lot of cases, the email only has some general information, and a link to an external website with the actual information they need. This adds an extra step that the user needs to take to get the information that they want, making it take longer to get that information. Using AMP enhanced emails, we can remove that extra step, instead of having to click through to another site, the user simply sees the most up to date information in the email.

Our project has been to create AMP enhanced emails that can be used to help educate consumers, and other companies that rely heavily on notification emails about the potential of AMP, and how it can make the users inbox be more productive. 

## Parcel Tracking

When you purchase something online, typically, you are sent a confirmation email with a link to track you package. An issue with this is that it requires the user to click though to a link to an outside site, and in some cases, users receive additional emails about the packages location.

This can be solved using AMP enhanced features in email. With AMP, when a user opens an emails, they see the latest information about the package, without having to receive multiple email. This removes the need to have to click though the email to an outside site, and creates a more productive inbox.

This demo is powered by Easypost, a parcel tracking service that is capable to tracking parcels across many different carriers in many different countries, including Canada Post, USPS, FedEx, UPS and more. Because this information is fetched as the email is opened, it is able to show the user: where it is, and when it is scheduled to arrive.
