Dimitry developed a keen interest in computers from the first time he used one. Throughout the years, this developed into an interest in computer programming and computer systems. After graduating high school, Dimitry worked to gain the prerequisites required for Software Engineering while working at a retail store. Eventually Dimitry decided that the Information Computer Systems program at Camosun College was a better fit for his interests.

## Intro

The client for this Capstone project was Dyspatch, a company located in Victoria with a history of sponsoring capstone projects. Their main products are an email production platform that aims to make creating enterprise email easier and faster by providing an API, editor, built in testing for devices, and an email template management system called Sendwithus. The sponsor for the project was Maryam Sheikh, the Engineering Manager at Dyspatch.

The production of email templates is a great value-generating task for Dyspatch. The templates can be used to demonstrate features to prospective clients, may have practical use to the company itself, and having examples to work from makes the creation of variants simpler both for Dyspatch and their clients. The work is technical enough that programming knowledge is a necessary asset. Unfortunately, experienced engineers have many tasks to do in a day and the production of email templates can be time consuming. The project aimed to solve this quandary by giving students the opportunity to do the work with oversight from Dyspatchâ€™s professionals.

Our team, rather laconically named Team Dyspatch, was privileged to be selected by Dyspatch to create several email templates that demonstrate their product's unique capabilities. Dysapatch has been unfailiningly supportive and welcoming and provided us with not only oversight and instruction but also integrated us within their day-to-day processes, allowing us to experience how a professional team works.

## About the project

When you receive an email, in a lot of cases, the email only has some general information, and a link to an external website with the actual information they need. This adds an extra step that the user needs to take to get the information that they want, making it take longer to get that information. Using AMP enhanced emails, we can remove that extra step, instead of having to click through to another site, the user simply sees the most up to date information in the email.

Our project has been to create AMP enhanced emails that can be used to help educate consumers, and other companies that rely heavily on notification emails about the potential of AMP, and how it can make the users inbox be more productive. 


## Parcel Tracking

When you purchase something online, typically, you are sent a confirmation email with a link to track you package. An issue with this is that it requires the user to click though to a link to an outside site, and in some cases, users receive additional emails about the packages location.

This can be solved using AMP enhanced features in email. With AMP, when a user opens an emails, they see the latest information about the package, without having to receive multiple email. This removes the need to have to click though the email to an outside site, and creates a more productive inbox.

This demo is powered by Easypost, a parcel tracking service that is capable to tracking parcels across many different carriers in many different countries, including Canada Post, USPS, FedEx, UPS and more. Because this information is fetched as the email is opened, it is able to show the user: where it is, and when it is scheduled to arrive.
