# Team Dyspatch

Team E or Team Dyspatch is composed of Karanvir Dhillon, Dimitry Maizik, and Dominique Hervochon. For this capstone project, we were privileged to be selected by Dyspatch to create several email templates that demonstrate their product's unique capabilities, with a focus on Dyspatch's use of Google's AMP for Email technology. Dyspatch has been unfailiningly supportive and welcoming and provided us with not only oversight and instruction but also integrated us within their day-to-day processes, allowing us to experience how a professional team works.

Dyspatch is a company located in Victoria with a history of sponsoring capstone projects. Their main products are an email production platform that aims to make creating enterprise email easier and faster by providing an API, editor, built in testing for devices, and an email template management system called Sendwithus. The sponsor for the project was Maryam Sheikh, the Engineering Manager at Dyspatch.

The production of email templates is a great value-generating task for Dyspatch. The templates can be used to demonstrate features to prospective clients, may have practical use to the company itself, and having examples to work from makes the creation of similar templates simpler both for Dyspatch and their clients. The work is technical enough that programming knowledge is a necessary asset. Unfortunately, experienced engineers have many tasks to do in a day and the production of email templates can be time consuming. The project aimed to solve this quandary by giving students the opportunity to do the work with Dyspatchâ€™s professionals only needing to provide oversight and mentorship.

## About the project

When you receive an email, in a lot of cases, the email only has some general information, and a link to an external website with the actual information they need. This adds an extra step that the user needs to take to get the information that they want, making it take longer to get that information. Using AMP enhanced emails, we can remove that extra step, instead of having to click through to another site, the user simply sees the most up to date information in the email.

Our project has been to create AMP enhanced emails that can be used to help educate consumers, and other companies that rely heavily on notification emails about the potential of AMP, and how it can make the users inbox be more productive. 

### What is AMP?

<img style="margin: auto;" alt="AMP + Gmail" src="https://esourcecapital.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/google-incorpora-amp-no-gmail-1.jpg" />

 AMP was origonally developed by Google in 2015, as on open source technology to boost loading speeds on mobile devices.
 Then in 2018 Google announced AMP-powered emails, that would create a interactive email experience.
 Now in 2021 AMP-powered emails, let you shop, and fill out forms in your email withought leaving your inbox.
 AMP-powered emails allow us to bringing live data into emails, and provide a powerful user experience.
 Anytime we use AMP technology there are unilitmied new possiblites, because we can now make emails feel more like interactive webpages.

## Some Apps


### Parcel Tracking

<div style="float: left;">
When you purchase something online, typically, you are sent a confirmation email with a link to track you package. An issue with this is that it requires the user to click though to a link to an outside site, and in some cases, users receive additional emails about the packages location.

This can be solved using AMP enhanced features in email. With AMP, when a user opens an emails, they see the latest information about the package, without having to receive multiple email. This removes the need to have to click though the email to an outside site, and creates a more productive inbox.


This demo is powered by Easypost, a parcel tracking service that is capable to tracking parcels across many different carriers in many different countries, including Canada Post, USPS, FedEx, UPS and more. Because this information is fetched as the email is opened, it is able to show the user: where it is, and when it is scheduled to arrive.

### Marketing Email

Dyspatch wants to send an email announcement about Dyspatch's AMP support to inform their marketing list about the possibilities and encourage them to try out the technology on Dyspatch's platform.

The email had a design already existing for us, but the blocks themselves needed to be created and the blog scraper needed caching implemented.

Broadly speaking the email implements most of AMPs most important features includeing a list to load data from a server, multiple forms for submitting data, and sensible fallback states for if the email can not connect to the internet or if it is sent to an email service provider that does not support AMP.

## Product reviews app with Yotpo

We wanted to create a product review email that would increase the product review submissions. By combining both AMP technology with Yotpo's product review system, we were able to create an email template. This email template would then be used by Dyspatch users, to send to their customers in email, by asking for a product review. 
By allowing customers to fill out reviews without needing to open a new browser tab, we hope to publish a valuable application for many businesses.

All reviews are sent to Yotpo's e-commerce analytics. Performance analytics are then available to bring digital solutions for marketing and sales teams.

## Conclusion 

Team Dyspatch would like to thank their project sponsors as well as the faculty at Camosun college for their continuous support during the capstone project. They would also like to thank everyone else involved with capstone for giving them the opportunity to work with Dyspatch.
