## About the project

When you receive an email, in a lot of cases, the email only has some general information, and a link to an external website with the actual information they need. This adds an extra step that the user needs to take to get the information that they want, making it take longer to get that information. Using AMP enhanced emails, we can remove that extra step, instead of having to click through to another site, the user simply sees the most up to date information in the email.

Our project has been to create AMP enhanced emails that can be used to help educate consumers, and other companies that rely heavily on notification emails about the potential of AMP, and how it can make the users inbox be more productive.
